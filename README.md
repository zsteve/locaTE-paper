# locaTE-paper
code and data for reproducing results from locaTE paper

## Notes 
* See `examples/` directory for scripts and notebooks directly used for generating results

* Results for a fixed parameter combination are available for the simulated data (stored in Git). To reproduce the full results of the grid search, you will need to re-run the computation pipeline (looking at `data/simulated/Synthetic_1000/gen.sh` is a good starting point)
